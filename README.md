# TinyWeb ðŸŒ± Rust on the client. No dependencies.

Build the client-side with Rust. Combine it with any http framework to build fullstack applications in canonical Rust!

# What's TinyWeb?

TinyWeb is a toolkit to build web applications that care about simplicity and correctness.

- It allows client side application to be build with canonical Rust utilizing its strict type system, zero-cost abstractions and great built-in tooling.

- Has a tiny footprint of less than 800 lines of code, has no build step and no external dependencies.

# Features

- No Javascript
- No macros
- No dependencies
- No build step
- Just HTML & Rust (Wasm)

**Note:** No build step besides `cargo build`

# Getting Started

### Use the starter project

- Fork the [tinyweb-starter](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb-starter) project

### Create a new project

Create a new Rust project with `cargo new tinyweb-example --lib`:

Update the `src/lib.rs`:
```rs
use tinyweb::element::El;
use tinyweb::invoke::Js;

fn component() -> El {
    El::new("div")
        .child(El::new("button").text("print").on_event("click", move |_| {
            Js::invoke("alert('hello browser')", &[]);
        }))
}

#[no_mangle]
pub fn main() {
    let body = Js::invoke("return document.querySelector('body')"]).to_ref().unwrap();
    component().mount(&body);
}
```

Then, create an `index.html` in a new `public` folder:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/LiveDuo/tinyweb/src/js/main.js"></script>
        <script type="application/wasm" src="client.wasm"></script>
    </head>
    <body></body>
</html>
```

Lastly, add `crate-type =["cdylib"]` right below `[lib]` section in `Cargo.toml`.

Then build the project with `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -r` and `cp target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/*.wasm public/client.wasm` to get the `.wasm` in the right place. You can now serve the contents of the `public` folder with your favourite static http server.



# How it works

At first, the Rust code is compiled to wasm with `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -r` and has to be serve alongside `index.html`. Once `index.html` is loaded in the browser, a [DOMContentLoaded](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/src/js/main.js#L114) event
is triggered in [main.js](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/src/js/main.js#L91) which loads the wasm file. Note that, in contrast to other Rust based frameworks, the javascript file here is static. That's because it does not use `wasm-bindgen` to build the browser bindings but instead the only types that are passed to and from javascript are primitive types such as numbers, strings, buffers and references to javascript objects.

Once the wasm file is loaded, the `main` function is [called](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/src/js/main.js#L96) and this function acts as an initialization hook similar to `DOMContentLoaded` in vanilla javascript or `useEffect` in React. The `main` function usually makes the initial rendering and registers listeners for different DOM elements.

Every time a rust function wants to invoke a browser API it uses the [__invoke](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/src/rust/src/invoke.rs#L84) which calls the [corresponding function](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/src/js/main.js#L64) in javascript. Callbacks such as event listeners are register through the `__invoke` function and then call a dedicated function in wasm named [handle_callback](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/src/rust/src/handlers.rs#L14).

# How to's & guides

### Browser APIs

```rs
use tinyweb::invoke::Js;

Js::invoke("alert('hello browser')", &[]);
```

### Reactivity and Signals

```rs

use tinyweb::signals::Signal;
use tinyweb::element::El;

let signal_count = Signal::new(0);

El::new("button").text("add").on_event("click", move |_| {
    let count = signal_count.get() + 1;
    signal_count.set(count);
});
```

### Router support

```rs
use tinyweb::router::{Page, Router};

thread_local! {
    pub static ROUTER: RefCell<Router> = RefCell::new(Router::default());
}

// initialize router
let pages = &[Page::new("/tasks", tasks_page(), None)];
ROUTER.with(|s| { *s.borrow_mut() = Router::new("body", pages); });

// navigate to route
ROUTER.with(|s| { s.borrow().navigate("/page1"); });
```

Check it out [here](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/examples/features/src/lib.rs#L21)

### Async Support

```rs
use tinyweb::runtime::Runtime;
use tinyweb::invoke::Js;

Runtime::block_on(async move {

    let (cb, future) = create_async_callback();
    Js::invoke("setTimeout({}, 1000)", &[Ref(cb)]);
    future.await;

    Js::invoke("alert('timer')");
});
```

# Backstory

For quite some time, I've been torn about typescript. It brings stronger typing to javascript making me more confident about the code but it comes with a heavy build system that makes debugging a lot more complex.

At some point I had to build a new application that I really cared that correctness and realized how much I don't trust typescript even for what's design to do.

I then tried different wasm based frameworks like Leptos and Yew. These crates were great at correctness and I was confident about the result but the come with a cost. Each requires hundereds of dependencies just to get started. For reference, leptos development tool `cargo-leptos` depends on other 485 crates and `leptos` itself on 231 more.

When I digged into it more, I realised that these dependencies come from `wasm-bindgen`. The `wasm-bindgen` crate is the standard in developing client side code with Rust and is maintained by [The Rust and WebAssembly Working Group](https://rustwasm.github.io), the group that's maintaining webassembly itself.

So, I setup out to build a web framework that allows to build client side applications with Rust but it's still simple and `tinyweb` is the result. A client side Rust framework built in <800 lines of code.
