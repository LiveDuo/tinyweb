# TinyWeb ðŸŒ± Rust on the client. No dependencies.

Build the client side with Rust! Backend agnostic. Less than 800 lines of code.

# What's TinyWeb?

TinyWeb is a toolkit for building web applications focused on both correctness and simplicity.

Enables client-side applications to be built in pure Rust, similar to backend applications, leveraging the language strict type system and great built-in tooling. Has a tiny footprint with less than 800 lines of code, has no build step and no external dependencies.


# Features

- No Javascript
- No macros
- No dependencies
- No build step
- Just HTML & Rust (Wasm)

**Note:** No build step besides `cargo build`

# Getting Started

### Use the starter project

- Fork the [tinyweb-starter](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb-starter) project

[![Tutorial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/master/.github/assets/tinyweb-youtube.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44P3IVnjEqo "Tutorial")

### Create a new project

1. Create a new Rust project with `cargo new tinyweb-example --lib`. Add `crate-type =["cdylib"]` in `Cargo.toml` and install the crate with `cargo add tinyweb --git https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb`.

2. Update the `src/lib.rs`:
```rs
use tinyweb::element::El;
use tinyweb::invoke::Js;

fn component() -> El {
    El::new("div")
        .child(El::new("button").text("print").on("click", move |_| {
            Js::invoke("alert('hello browser')", &[]);
        }))
}

#[no_mangle]
pub fn main() {
    let body = Js::invoke("return document.querySelector('body')"]).to_ref().unwrap();
    component().mount(&body);
}
```

3. Create an `index.html` in a new `public` folder:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/LiveDuo/tinyweb/src/js/main.js"></script>
        <script type="application/wasm" src="client.wasm"></script>
    </head>
    <body></body>
</html>
```



4. Build the project with `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -r`. Then `cp target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/*.wasm public/client.wasm` to get the `.wasm` in the right place and serve the `public` folder with any static http server.



# How it works

**Initialization:** Each project built with TinyWeb has 3 components, an `index.html`, a static `main.js` and a `client.wasm` file compiled from Rust with `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -r`. These files can be served with any static HTTP server. When the website is visited, the `index.html` file loads the [main.js](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/src/js/main.js) file which registers a [DOMContentLoaded](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/src/js/main.js) event listener. When the page finishes loading, the listener is triggered which [calls](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/src/js/main.js) the `main` function in the wasm file (usually making the initial DOM rendering and registering event listeners).

**Browser APIs:** When a Rust function wants to invoke a browser API, it uses the [__invoke](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/src/rust/src/invoke.rs) function internally, which in turn calls its [counterpart](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/src/js/main.js) in Javascript.

**Callbacks:** When a listener is registered in Rust, it takes a callback function as a parameter and that function is stored in [CALLBACK_HANDLERS](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/src/rust/src/callbacks.rs). Every time the callback is triggered, the [handle_callback](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/src/rust/src/handlers.rs) function is called which executes the callback function that was stored earlier.

# How to's & guides

### Browser APIs

```rs
use tinyweb::invoke::Js;

Js::invoke("alert('hello browser')", &[]);
```

### Reactivity and Signals

```rs

use tinyweb::signals::Signal;
use tinyweb::element::El;

let signal_count = Signal::new(0);

El::new("button").text("add").on("click", move |_| {
    let count = signal_count.get() + 1;
    signal_count.set(count);
});
```

### Router support

```rs
use tinyweb::router::{Page, Router};

thread_local! {
    pub static ROUTER: RefCell<Router> = RefCell::new(Router::default());
}

// initialize router
let pages = &[Page::new("/page1", page_component(), None)];
ROUTER.with(|s| { *s.borrow_mut() = Router::new("body", pages); });

// navigate to route
ROUTER.with(|s| { s.borrow().navigate("/page1"); });
```

Check it out [here](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/examples/features/src/lib.rs)

### Async Support

```rs
use tinyweb::runtime::Runtime;
use tinyweb::invoke::Js;

Runtime::block_on(async move {
    Runtime::promise("window.setTimeout({},{})", move |c| vec![c.into(), 1_000.into()]).await;
    Js::invoke("alert('timer')");
});
```

# Backstory

For quite some time, I couldn't decide if I like Typescript or not. On one hand, it offers stronger typing than pure JavaScript, providing more confidence in the code; but on the other hand, it comes with a heavy build system that complicates things and makes debugging significantly harder.

When I had to build an application where I really cared about correctness, I realized how much I didn't trust Typescript even for what's designed to do and I tried different Rust based web frameworks instead. While these frameworks alleviated correctness concerns, they introduced significant complexity, requiring hundreds of dependencies just to get started. For reference, `leptos` depends on 231 crates and its development tool `cargo-leptos` depends on another 485 crates.

Many of these dependencies come from the `wasm-bindgen` crate, which generates Rust bindings for browser APIs and the JavaScript glue code needed for these calls and is used almost universally by Rust based web frameworks as a lower level building block for accessing browser APIs.

Yet, using this crate is not the only way to interact with browser APIs and many applications could benefit from a different tool that makes different tradeoffs. In particular, many applications might benefit from simplicity and ease of debuggging, I know the application I'm building probably would.

So, I set out to build a web framework that allows to build client side applications with Rust and has minimal footprint. The result is `TinyWeb`, a client side Rust framework built in <800 lines of code.
