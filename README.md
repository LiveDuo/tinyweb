# TinyWeb ðŸŒ± Rust on the client. No dependencies.

Build the client side with Rust! Compatible with any HTTP framework for creating full-stack applications in pure Rust!

# What's TinyWeb?

TinyWeb is a toolkit for building web applications focused on both correctness and simplicity.

Enables client-side applications to be built in pure Rust, similar to backend applications, leveraging the language strict type system and great built-in tooling. Has a tiny footprint with less than 800 lines of code, has no build step and no external dependencies.

# Features

- No Javascript
- No macros
- No dependencies
- No build step
- Just HTML & Rust (Wasm)

**Note:** No build step besides `cargo build`

# Getting Started

### Use the starter project

- Fork the [tinyweb-starter](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb-starter) project

### Create a new project

Create a new Rust project with `cargo new tinyweb-example --lib`:

Update the `src/lib.rs`:
```rs
use tinyweb::element::El;
use tinyweb::invoke::Js;

fn component() -> El {
    El::new("div")
        .child(El::new("button").text("print").on_event("click", move |_| {
            Js::invoke("alert('hello browser')", &[]);
        }))
}

#[no_mangle]
pub fn main() {
    let body = Js::invoke("return document.querySelector('body')"]).to_ref().unwrap();
    component().mount(&body);
}
```

Then, create an `index.html` in a new `public` folder:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/LiveDuo/tinyweb/src/js/main.js"></script>
        <script type="application/wasm" src="client.wasm"></script>
    </head>
    <body></body>
</html>
```

Lastly, add `crate-type =["cdylib"]` right below `[lib]` section in `Cargo.toml`.

Then build the project with `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -r` and `cp target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/*.wasm public/client.wasm` to get the `.wasm` in the right place. Then serve the `public` folder with any static http server.



# How it works

**Components:** Each project built with TinyWeb has 3 components, an `index.html`, a static `main.js` and a `client.wasm` file compiled from Rust with `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -r`. These files can be served with any static HTTP server.

**Initialization:** When the website is visited, the `index.html` file loads the [main.js](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/src/js/main.js) file which registers a [DOMContentLoaded](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/src/js/main.js) event listener. When the page finishes loading, the listener is triggered which [calls](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/src/js/main.js) the `main` function in the wasm file (usually making the initial DOM rendering and registering event listeners).

**Browser APIs:** When a Rust function wants to invoke a browser API, it uses the [__invoke](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/src/rust/src/invoke.rs) function internally, which in turn calls its [counterpart](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/src/js/main.js) in Javascript.

**Callbacks:** When a listener is registered in Rust, it takes a callback function as a parameter and that function is stored in [CALLBACK_HANDLERS](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/src/rust/src/callbacks.rs). Every time the callback is triggered, the [handle_callback](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/src/rust/src/handlers.rs) function is called which executes the callback function that was stored earlier.

# How to's & guides

### Browser APIs

```rs
use tinyweb::invoke::Js;

Js::invoke("alert('hello browser')", &[]);
```

### Reactivity and Signals

```rs

use tinyweb::signals::Signal;
use tinyweb::element::El;

let signal_count = Signal::new(0);

El::new("button").text("add").on_event("click", move |_| {
    let count = signal_count.get() + 1;
    signal_count.set(count);
});
```

### Router support

```rs
use tinyweb::router::{Page, Router};

thread_local! {
    pub static ROUTER: RefCell<Router> = RefCell::new(Router::default());
}

// initialize router
let pages = &[Page::new("/page1", page_component(), None)];
ROUTER.with(|s| { *s.borrow_mut() = Router::new("body", pages); });

// navigate to route
ROUTER.with(|s| { s.borrow().navigate("/page1"); });
```

Check it out [here](https://github.com/LiveDuo/tinyweb/blob/feature/readme/examples/features/src/lib.rs)

### Async Support

```rs
use tinyweb::runtime::Runtime;
use tinyweb::invoke::Js;

Runtime::block_on(async move {

    let (cb, future) = create_async_callback();
    Js::invoke("setTimeout({}, 1000)", &[cb.into()]);
    future.await;

    Js::invoke("alert('timer')");
});
```

# Backstory

For quite some time, I couldn't decide if I like Typescript or not. On one hand, it has stronger typing than pure Javascript bringing more confidence about the code but on the other hand it comes with a heavy build system that makes complicates the project a lot and makes debugging a significantly harder.

When I had to build a application where I really cared that correctness, I realized how much I don't trust Typescript even for what's designed to do and I tried different wasm based web frameworks that allow building web applications using Rust. These frameworks alleviated the correctness concern but they complicate things a lot requiring hundereds of dependencies just to get started. For reference, `leptos` depends on 231 crates and its development tool `cargo-leptos` depends on another 485 crates.

A major reason for this complexity is that these frameworks depend on the `wasm-bindgen` crate that build the Rust bindings for browser APIs and the Javascript glue code that allows making these calls. But the `wasm-bindgen` is just one way to interact with browser APIs that trades off simplicity for performance and not all applications benefit from this trade off. The application I'm building most probably wouldn't.

So, I set out to build a web framework that allows to build client side applications with Rust that has a minimal footprint. The result is `TinyWeb`, a client side Rust framework built in <800 lines of code.
